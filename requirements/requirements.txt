1. sys admin config link
2. specialities
3. Task list for the hairdressers
4. add allocated clients tab to the dashboard

For the admins dashboard’s tabs 

New clients( we need an algorithm that can assign clients to each admin automatically as they come in)

Assigned Clients( clients the admins have processed and can manage their active booking as to change dates add other services or change services basically modify active bookings)

Historic clients( where admins can see bookings that have happened and see reviews

Hairdressers (each admins list of their own hairdressers with a calendar of their availability slots)

Below there must be a task function that tells the admin which steps are outstanding, how many clients have not been assisted and urgent messages to look out for

Incontact messaging for admins and the clients

For new clients once an admin processes that client there needs to be a security code they put that locs in that client as their own


================
booking process
================
Basically the Booking process has steps and all those steps should be completed for it to be a successful booking, if that’s not met it should give an error and go to the To do list eg Error! “Step4” provide confirmation to the client

From the new clients tab they have been assigned step 1 they should assign a hairdresser based on the specifications the client provided 

Step2 
Once hairdresser confirms then send confirmation to client and wait for client to accept and confirm it as booked

Step 3 will be CRM (Admin has to sign off the booking has happened and client is happy)

No we will send payment link on the day of their booking

=================
registration
=================
so each hairdresser will be assigned to an administrator when they are registered onto the system? 

=================
general
=================

Then admins should be able to book hairdressers that are not theirs so when that happens it should show which admin booked them

The hairdresser database should have their availability and who booked them on which days
